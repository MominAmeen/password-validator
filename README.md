# Password-Validation Form 🔐

![Screenshot](./screenshot-form-preview.png)

This is a simple React-based password validation form that checks for password strength using multiple criteria:

- Minimum 8 characters  
- At least one uppercase letter  
- At least one lowercase letter  
- At least one number  
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

Built using **React functional components** and **TypeScript**, this is my first step into React development.
